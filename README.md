ðŸ™ˆ Iâ€™m aware that this README needs **more love**. Time is the biggest challenge here. Feel free to [buzz me on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy) if you have any questions or comments.

The **assets** are all the elements that were needed to create the website.

- Text in markdown format (*.md)
- Images (various stage, till the final result)
- Logos
- Infographic file (Keynote, pdd files)
- Backup files (json)

## Industry
**Barbershop Avenue** is a demo website that mimics what someone would expect from a barbershop / hairdresser business.

You can view a live demo and edit the website on [play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/) project.

## The Goal
I want to teach you how to fish. The idea is to give you the big picture about how this website was actually build.

I put together assets (pictures, logo, keynote, psd). It's all open source and you can download it here. If you wish and if you are curious, you will probably quickly understand how to recreate a similar website on your own.

At [FirePress](http://firepress.org/) ðŸ”¥ðŸ“°, our mission is to empower entrepreneurs, freelancers and organizations to build an outstanding mobile-first website. We are actually in beta. Go to [play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/) for more details.

Specifically, this is the default **content** we use for all new Ghost installations at FirePress ðŸ”¥ðŸ“°. By doing this extra step for our clients, they can see quickly how their brand new website feels like. As new publishers, they can also understand how to put together a website.

## What this repo is not
This repo does not contain the source of Ghost or the template but only the assets used to create the website. Try it yourself on [play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/).
