## Styling 101

**This is bold** and this is *italic*. You can create an *absolute* link [like this one](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). You can create a *relative* link to pages and posts within your [own website](../style-guide/).

Sometimes you want to have your visitor to open a **link into a new tab**. This is where you can <a href="https://twitter.com/askpascalandy" target="_blank">find me on Twitter</a>

Everyone loves straight to the point **bullet points**:

- The first rule is: be honest
- The second rule is: see rule number one
- Rule number #3 should be here too


**Fancy elements**:

The <s>s element</s> example
The <mark>mark element</mark> example
The <samp>samp element</samp> example
The <small>small element</small> example
The <sub>sub element</sub> example
The <sup>sup element</sup> example
The <kbd>kbd element</kbd> example

**Horizontal bar** is made by using three minus signs `---`.

## Image


This is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense at that are harvested at that mysteriously rich. Thanks to [Icons8](https://photos.icons8.com/) for the picture.

![summer-is-the-best-time-of-the-year-2-b](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/content/images/2018/05/summer-is-the-best-time-of-the-year-2-b.jpg)

This is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense. This text is used as a filler. Words that will follow won't make any sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.

### Clickable image

We need two things: a URL and a picture.
Think: « I don't want to click a text, I want to click an image.
[See this GIF](https://cl.ly/3U0G3a2D412g) to do it.

# Table
There are 3 ways to edit a table.


## Option 1) Grid table

The **best way** to do it is by using a grid system. We use [this one](http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid/). This is a classic **pricing table** with a ratio of: `10/12` on the left and `2/12` on the right.


### Our Pizzas

<br>

<div class="grid">
	<div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
		<div class="content">
			<strong>The Montréal Special</strong><br>
			<em>Fresh basil, mozzarella and olive oil
            Mozzarella di buffala (+4$), Anchovies (+ 1$)</em>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
		<div class="content right">
			<strong>21$</strong>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="grid">
	<div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
		<div class="content">
			<strong>Quattro Formaggi</strong>
			<em>Mozzarella, Aosta Valley fontina, parmesan and spicy provolone</em>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
		<div class="content right">
			<strong>18$</strong>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="grid">
	<div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
		<div class="content">
			<strong>The Meat Lover</strong><br>
			<em>Fresh basil, Prosciutto crudo, mozzarella and arugula</em>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
		<div class="content right">
			<strong>24$</strong>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

### Corporate services

**The Blue plan includes:**

<div class="grid">
	<div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
		<div class="content">
			● Publish original content on 3 social networks<br> ● Once a day<br> ● 5 days a week<br> ● Billed each month
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
		<div class="content push-right">
			1475$
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

**The Green plan includes:**

<div class="grid">
	<div class="col-10-12 mobile-col-10-12">
		<div class="content">
			<i class="far fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp; Publish original content on 3 social networks<br> <i class="far fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp; Twice a day<br> <i class="far fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp; 5 days a week<br> <i class="far fa-check-square"></i> &nbsp; Billed each month
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-2-12 mobile-col-2-12">
		<div class="content push-right">
			2495$
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<br>

Here is a classic **50/50 table** with a ratio of: `6/12` on the left and `6/12` on the right. 

<div class="grid">
	<div class="col-6-12 mobile-col-6-12">
		<div class="content">
			This is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense. This text is used as a filler. Words that will follow won't make any sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-6-12 mobile-col-6-12">
		<div class="content push-right">
			This is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense. This text is used as a filler. Words that will follow won't make any sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<br>

Just because we can, let's hack a **bigger space** between the two columns:

<div class="grid">
	<div class="col-6-12 mobile-col-6-12">
		<div class="content">
			This is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense. This text is used as a filler. Words that will follow won't make any sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.
		</div>
	</div>
    	<div class="col-1-12 mobile-col-1-12">
		<div class="content">
			&nbsp;
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-5-12 mobile-col-5-12">
		<div class="content push-right">
			This is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense. This text is used as a filler. Words that will follow won't make any sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

## Option 2) Markdown table

Another way to create tables is to use plain markdown. 

**Allignement:** description: left, price: right 

| Description                   | Price |
| :------                       | ---: |
| Black top pomade              | $25 |
| Fiber pomade                  | $20 |
| Free form cream               | $24 |
| Matte pomade paste            | $24 |

<br>

This is a placeholder text to give context. You are about to read words that won't make sense. This text is used as a filler. Words that will follow won't make any sense, and this is fine. At the moment, the goal is to build a structure for our site.

**Allignement:** description: left, price: left

| Free form cream               | $24 |

## Option 3) HTML table

This works as well but we find it's behavior more difficult to predict and it's trickier to edit.

### Variation A

<table class="table is-bordered is-striped is-narrow is-fullwidth">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Firstname</th>
			<th>Lastname</th>
			<th>Age</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td>Jill</td>
		<td>Smith</td>
		<td>50</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Eve</td>
		<td>Jackson</td>
		<td>94</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<br>

### Variation B

**Using ratios** we can accomplish this:

<table width="100%">
	<tbody>
		<td style="width:3%;"></td>
		<td style="width:82%;"><br>
			<strong>Host one website</strong>
			<ul><br>
				<li>Includes a landing page and a Ghost installation</li>
				<li>A subtle FirePress link on the landing page (1)</li>
				<li>Get <strong>two months free</strong> when subscribing for the whole year</li><br>
				<p><a href="https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/get-your-free-10-day-trial-on-ghost/" class="button button-block button-primary button-rounded">Start your 10-Day trial ></a></p>
			</ul>
		</td>
		<td style="width:15%;"><br>
			<strong>15$</strong> /month</td>
	</tbody>
</table>

### Variation C

<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="width:60%;">Header 1</th>
<th style="width:20%;">Header 2</th>
<th style="width:20%;">Header 3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Division 1</td>
<td>Division 2</td>
<td>Division 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Division 1</td>
<td>Division 2</td>
<td>Division 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Division 1</td>
<td>Division 2</td>
<td>Division 3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Variation D (with headers)

<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="width:80%;">Description</th>
<th style="width:20%;">Price</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Item green</td>
<td>19$</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Item red</td>
<td>24$</td>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Item yellow</td>
<td>1500$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Variation E (no headers)

<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<td style="width:72%;">Item green</td>
<td>19$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width:28%;">Item red</td>
<td>24$</td>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Item yellow</td>
<td>1500$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Variation F

<table width="100%"> 
<tbody>
<td style="width:3%;"></td>
<td style="width:82%;"><br>
<strong>Offer's name</strong><ul><br>
<li>Some details here 1</li>
<li>Some details here 2</li>
<li>Some details here 3</li>
</ul></td>
<td style="width:15%;"><br>
<strong>89$</strong></td> 
</tbody>
</table>

### Variation G

<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<td style="width:50%;"><a href="#" class="button button-block button-primary button-rounded">See all elements</a></td>
<td style="width:50%;"><a href="#" class="button button-block button-primary button-rounded">See all elements</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

# Buttons

This is **the one**. We love to use this button at FirePress 🔥. It's our *one-size-fit-all* recommandation. See how responsive, clean and unmissable this button is:

<a href="https://play-with-ghost.com/" class="button button-block button-primary button-rounded">Launch your website</a>

---


Here are more details if you are *(really)* interested:

1. The attribute `button` indicate to the markdown editor it needs to generate a button.
2. The attribute `button-block` makes this button **responsive**. In other words, the button takes all the width available depending on which device the page is viewed.
3. The attribute `button-primary` defines the blue **color**. 
4. The attribute `button-rounded` define the button's **shape**.

In the section below, see the **three main attributes** you can chose from to create the button of you dreams (or kind of ...).

There is **more styles available** if your are curious. Just copy-paste [this markdown content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme_Assets/master/markdown/button-elements.md) into your Ghost editor and see for yourself.
